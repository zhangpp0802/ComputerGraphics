Learning Activity
============================================================================
1)  Look in the 'lib' directory.  There you'll find the library file 
'cuon-matrix-quat03.js', an extended version of the book's rudimentary 
vector/matrix library ('cuon-matrix.js').  This updated version includes 
prototypes for quaternion objects, complete with supporting functions.

2) Make some simple quaternions for testing; compare your results to those 
you create for same 3D axis+angles using this on-line quaternion calculator:
     http://www.energid.com/resources/orientation-calculator/ 

For example, create these quaternions:
--q0: a LONG Quaternion (magnitude larger than 1) that rotates by +30 degrees around +X axis
--q1: a SHORT Quaternion (magnitude less than 1) that rotates by -45 degrees around the +Z axis
--q2: a Quaternion that rotates by +90 degrees around the (1,1,1) axis
--'Normalize' each of these quaternions and print them on-screen.

4) Convert q0 and q1 to rotation matrices R0 and R1.
   Do they agree with our online calculator?

<!
5) Use Matrix4.concatenate() function (does 4x4 matrix multiply) to make two
new matrices by multiplying R0 and R1:
	[R01] = [R0][R1]  and 
	[R10] = [R1][R0]
>
<!
6) Similarly, use quaternion multiply function to make two new quaternions by
multiplying q0 and q1:
q01 = q0*q1 and q10 = q1*q0.
--Convert q01 and q10 to rotation matrices;  
   Do these match the online calculator's results?
   Which quaternions (q10 or q10) yields a rotation matrix that matches R01? R10? Why?
